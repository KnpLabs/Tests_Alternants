# Palindrome

A palindrome is a number that can be read the same way from left to right or from right to left (for example 99, 909).
The largest palindrome from the multiplication of two natural integers strictly less than 100 is 9009 (91 x 99).
If we consider the multiplication of two natural integers strictly less than 999, what is the largest palindrome that we can get?
