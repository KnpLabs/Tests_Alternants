# Code legacy

It's a console application (very at the forefront of new web trends^^) allowing to know the balance of each user to know who owes money to whom.

Some users pay for common expenses among participants. Each expense should be split equally between participants. For example if `A` pays 30€ for something that benefits `A`, `B` and `C`, then `B` and `C` should owe 10€ each to `A`.
A user can pay something that doesn't benefits to himself.

This application was developed by several different developers and is no longer very clean.

As is, the code cannot even work. When we launch the index.php file with a PHP interpreter, the application returns an error.
**WITHOUT EDITING THE `index.php` FILE**, make sure that the application returns what is expected.

## What is expected

You will have to make a PR (Pull request) modifying different files (possibility to add and/or delete) which makes the application functional (no error and operational calculation) and greatly improving the existing codebase.
