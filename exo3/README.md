# Code legacy

It's a console application (very at the forefront of new web trends^^) allowing to know the balance of each user to know who owes money to whom.

This application was developed by several different developers and is no longer very clean.

As is, the code cannot work. When we launch the index.php file with a PHP interpreter, the application returns an error.
WITHOUT TOUCHING THE index.php FILE, make sure that the application returns what is expected.

## What is expected

You will have to make a PR (Pull request) modifying different files (possibility to add and/or delete) which makes the application functional and greatly improving the existing codebase.
